# immunOS Tier 0 (Short): Hypothesis + Software Overview

**One‑paragraph summary**

immunOS is a local‑first verification system that applies artificial immune system (AIS) principles to
research integrity and AI safety. The core hypothesis is that self vs non‑self discrimination can be
implemented as a multi‑agent immune architecture that detects hallucinations, unsupported claims, and
incoherent reasoning. This Tier 0 release is a citable software overview for early dissemination; it
includes no empirical results or performance claims.

**Key points**

- Multi‑agent immune roles: B‑cell, NK‑cell, dendritic, T‑cell, memory.
- Local‑first execution for air‑gapped and reproducible workflows.
- Negative selection detectors for anomaly detection.
- Audit‑friendly logs and provenance‑aware outputs.

**Terminology**

- **antigent**: antigen + agent, a single immune‑style agent instance
- **antigents**: the set of immune agents in a run
- **Antigence™ (TM pending)**: platform brand identity (research identity layer)
- **antigentic**: workflows designed around self/non‑self detection

**Scope**

Tier 0 is intentionally limited to hypothesis + software description. It does not report benchmarks,
training metrics, or comparative results. Those are reserved for Tier 1 and Tier 2 releases.

**Availability**

- Codebase: https://github.com/biobitworks/immunos
- Full Tier 0 manuscript: `immunos-preprint-tier0.md`
