# Pitch: immunOS (Antigence™ (TM pending))

## One-line
Artificial immune system for AI integrity, safety, and scientific verification.

## Problem
AI outputs can be wrong, unsafe, or fabricated. Current guardrails are brittle and lack provenance. Scientific and safety-critical workflows need verifiable trust boundaries.

## Solution
immunOS models biological immunity in software:
- **Dendritic layer** extracts structured signals from outputs.
- **NK cells** use negative selection to detect non-self anomalies.
- **B cells** provide supervised verification where labels exist.
- **Memory cells** reuse validated patterns for stable decisions.
- **Secure core** cryptographically defines and protects self.

## Traction (POC)
- Research NK F1: 71.7%
- Network NK F1: 89.5%
- Code Security NK F1: 88.5%
- Hallucination NK F1: 61.2% (target 70%)

## Roadmap (12 months)
- **Q1**: Domain packs for research, hallucination, network, code security.
- **Q2**: Secure core (signing + trust enforcement + audit trail).
- **Q3**: Deployment demo for scientific QA workflows.
- **Q4**: Scaling and integration with safety-critical pipelines.

## Ask
Funding + compute for GPU training and an air-gapped deployment baseline.
