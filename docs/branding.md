# Branding: Antigence™, Antigents, Antigentic

## Purpose
Define the lexicon for immunOS branding and keep usage consistent across docs, pitches, and domain packs.

## Core Terms

### Antigence™ (TM pending)
**Definition**: Antigen + intelligence. The platform name for the system that coordinates antigents and enforces self/non-self boundaries.

**Usage**:
- Use "Antigence™" to describe the overall platform identity.
- Use "immunOS" to refer to the technical architecture and methods.

### Antigent (singular)
**Definition**: One antigen-specialized agent within a domain pack.

**Usage**:
- "Network NK antigent" or "Research verification antigent".

### Antigents (plural)
**Definition**: A set of specialized agents trained on a domain's antigen class.

**Usage**:
- "The research domain pack ships with antigents for claim verification." 

### Antigentic
**Definition**: Adjective describing workflows or systems designed around antigen detection and immune-style response logic.

**Usage**:
- "Antigentic workflows emphasize provenance and trust boundaries."

## Positioning
- **Antigence™** = the platform brand.
- **immunOS** = the underlying immune-system architecture.
- **Antigents** = the domain-specific agents.
- **Antigentic** = the style of workflow/design.

## Messaging Notes
- Emphasize self vs non-self boundaries and auditability.
- Avoid implying medical claims or clinical diagnostics unless validated.
- Highlight "immune-inspired" rather than "medical" in public copy.

## Trademark Clearance Checklist (Manual)
1. USPTO Trademark Search System (TESS): search for Antigence and close variants.
2. Common-law search: web, GitHub, and domain records for similar names.
3. Class selection: likely software/SaaS/data services.
4. First-use log: record earliest public use (Zenodo, website, or press).
5. Filing readiness: standard word mark application (TEAS) once clearance is clean.
