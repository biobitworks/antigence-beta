# Roadmap: Frontier Artificial Immune Systems (F-AIS)

## Vision
To develop a supervisory "Immune Layer" capable of real-time "Self/Non-Self" discrimination for Frontier AI models, identifying hallucinations, adversarial injections, and alignment drift without requiring a static database.

## Platform: Frontier Hybrid Compute (2026 Q1)
**Purpose**: Local-first development of a frontier hybrid model for Self/Non-Self discrimination (LLM + AIS).
**Hardware**: Apple M2 Max (12-core CPU, 38-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine), 96GB unified memory, 512GB SSD.
**I/O**: Thunderbolt 4, 10Gb Ethernet, SDXC, multi-display support for multi-panel monitoring.
**Impact**: Enables multi-agent concurrency, local embedding pipelines, and real-time AIS supervision without relying on cloud inference.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current - 2026 Q1)
**Project: IMMUNOS NegSl-AIS Recreation**
- **Objective**: Establish baseline accuracy (94-98%) on biological multimodal data.
- **Publication Core**: bioRxiv Preprint (Antigence-Alpha).
- **Key Technology**: Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA) with modality biasing.

## Phase 2: Knowledge Immunization (2026 Q2-Q3)
**Project: The Citation Guardian**
- **Objective**: Zero-shot detection of metadata hallucinations (DOIs, Author-Paper domain mismatches).
- **Metric**: Suppression of fake citations with >90% precision.
- **Key Technology**: Embedding-space antibodies and probabilistic cross-consistency.

## Phase 3: Behavioral Antibodies (2026 Q4 - 2027)
**Project: Frontier Model Supervision**
- **Objective**: Monitor the "Self" behavior of a Frontier model. Detect shifts in output distribution that indicate jailbreaking or neural decay.
- **Mechanism**: The F-AIS acts as a "Secondary Model" (Lymphocyte) that observes the "Primary Model" (Frontier LLM).
- **Research Citation Path**:
  - *Forrest et al. (1994)*: Original NSA for Computer Security.
  - *Umair et al. (2025)*: Multimodal Bio-signal AIS.
  - *Antigence Preprint (2026)*: Generalization to LLM Safety.

## Phase 4: Decentralized Collective Immunity (2027+)
**Project: The Antigence Network**
- **Objective**: Multi-agent AIS where different "Immune Agents" share detector sets (Horizontal Gene Transfer) to protect against novel threat vectors.

## Strategic Research Targets
1.  **Distributed AIS**: How do we scale negative selection across trillion-parameter embedding spaces?
2.  **Affinity Maturation**: Can we use Reinforcement Learning to "evolve" better detectors for hallucinations?
3.  **Cross-Modal AIS**: Fusing text, logit distributions, and system telemetry into a single biological defense metaphor.
